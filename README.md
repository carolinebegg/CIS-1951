# CIS 1951 - iOS Programming (Fall 2024)

This repository contains the projects developed for my iOS programming class taken in Fall 2024 (Junior Fall). The course focuses on building applications for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI, exploring both fundamental and advanced concepts of mobile app development.

## Course Overview

The course is project-oriented, aimed at understanding and applying the core concepts of iOS app development. The topics covered throughout the semester include:

### Week 1: Introduction to iOS Development and Xcode
- Overview of the iOS platform and its evolution.
- Installing and navigating Xcode.
- Creating a simple "Hello, World!" app.
- Introduction to Swift Playgrounds for Swift experimentation.

### Week 2: Swift Basics
- Variables, constants, and data types.
- Control flow (if-else, loops, switch cases).
- Functions (declaration, parameters, return types).
- Structs, classes, protocols, and basic error handling.

### Week 3: SwiftUI Fundamentals
- Introduction to SwiftUI's declarative syntax.
- Building basic UIs (Text, Image, Button).
- Layout system: VStack, HStack, ZStack.
- Using modifiers and creating lists/scrolling views.
- Debugging tools in Xcode.

### Week 4: SwiftUI State Management
- View hierarchy and data passing in SwiftUI.
- Property wrappers: `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, `@StateObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`.
- Building forms and handling user input.
- Basic animations and transitions.

### Week 5: App Lifecycle and Structure
- Lifecycle events: `onAppear`, `onDisappear`.
- Navigation: `NavigationStack`, `NavigationLink`, `TabView`.
- MVVM architecture.
- Modal presentations: `.sheet`, `.alert`.

### Week 6: Custom Views & Event Handling
- Working with `GeometryReader` and SwiftUI shapes.
- Event propagation and custom gesture recognition.
- Keyboard handling and text input events.

### Week 7: Working with Sensors
- Accessing device sensors: GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope.
- Using Core Motion and Core Location for sensor data.
- Practical use cases for sensor integration in apps.

### Week 8: Networking in iOS
- Making HTTP requests and using `async/await`.
- Networking with `URLSession` and JSON parsing.
- Error handling and best practices for networking.

### Week 9: Data Persistence
- Introduction to `UserDefaults` for simple storage.
- Using Core Data for complex data models and persistence.
- CRUD operations and file management in iOS.
- Additional data storage options: Keychain, SwiftData.

### Week 10: UIKit & UIKit Integration with SwiftUI
- Basics of UIKit and the MVC architecture.
- Integrating UIKit into SwiftUI using `UIViewRepresentable`.
- Managing user interaction and combining UIKit with SwiftUI.

### Week 11: App Design and User Experience
- UI design process and mobile app design principles.
- Multi-platform compatibility and accessibility in iOS.

### Week 12: Bonus Lecture (TBD)
- Potential topics like AR, Core ML, Widgets, or IoT integration.

## Final Project
The course culminates in a team-based final project, where groups of 3 students develop a fully functional iOS application, presenting their work at the end of the semester.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue adding projects from each week and the final project presentation!
